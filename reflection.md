Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Dani, Ari. Affirmed some of my testing and code.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
     Monday 9/25 at 7 pm. I didn't have many specific questions for the TA to help with so our exchange ended up pretty brief; it didn't really change my thinking about the assignment.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    I have some previous experiences with Java, but this was a good exercise to jog my memory on things I've forgotten how to do.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I can draw the conclusion that in general programming languages are very similar and it's easy to learn one if you know another, but for edge cases and more specific features of a new language there may be things you wouldn't expect.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? 
    I initially tried to use contains() and replace() without using split, which worked but made looping much more complicated than it had to be. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to use split from the get go. I liked using a String instead of an array to store the transcript, since it cut out the middle man of having to construct a toString() function. One downside in general of using a String instead of an array for something like this is that it's harder to go back and change something once it's stored, but in this specific instance the transcript would never have to be revised so it wasn't a problem.
